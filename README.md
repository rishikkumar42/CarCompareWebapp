# CarCompareWebapp

Welcome
Welcome to the MIE350 Team 17’s Car Comparison Java Web Application. The purpose of this application is to serve as a proof of concept for the need the team has identified at the start of the project.
This web application falls under the category of a Consumer Information Site, with the product being cars. This web application addresses the need for users to be able to find cars based on their set of preferences of car features. The gap that this web application closes is that many vehicle search services, whether it is done manually or using another application, results in a breadth of cars that requires the user to filter through. It is a process that is both time consuming and can be a nuisance and often results in the user not effectively finding the best car for them. With our Car Comparison web application, we look to recommend a vehicle using our robust recommendation algorithm and to effectively reduce the time spent looking for the ideal vehicle based on the user. The driving force for this website topic was the increase in new vehicles being sold and registered in Ontario, and by the Adam Smith’s Invisible Hand theory regarding economic decisions making [1][2][3][4].

Rishik Kumar
Front-end Lead/ Web Arcitect - did everything and debugged every line of broken code we sent his way

Cheryl Xu
Front end developer - Helped work on Front-End Architecture and Layout, Information flow analyst (uml diagrams)




This web application was developed using the following:

Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers,
The Java programming language,
Java Server Pages (JSP),
Apache Tomcat 7.0, and
A simple Microsoft Access database.
 
This Car Comparison Web App

The car comparison web application completes the following processes:

Search for students in the database.
Registers new users by storing the required information in the database.
Logs in existing members to the system to be able to use the compare function of the web application.
Logs out an existing user whenever their session is brought to a close.
Stores a registered user’s preferences of car features.
Saves a list of cars that a registered user has interest in.
